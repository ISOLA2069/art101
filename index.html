		<h1> Isola Tong <h2>

			<p>
				Isola Tong (Libra, Fire Rabbit, Manila, Philippines) is a Filipinx-Chinese artist and architect engaging the intersection of autochthonous queerness and nature through performance, installation, print, painting and moving image to disrupt and explore the tensions in the binarized understandings of nature and culture. She comes from a line of Babaylan or Filipinx shamans in the central region of the Philippine archipelago.

				Tongâ€™s ongoing artistic research involves queer cultures embedded in indigenous shamanistic histories, its frictions with postcolonial realities, and the visualizations of ecology in human and nonhuman encounters. In her developing practice, the preternatural class of the spiritual Babaylan becomes one of her points of reference, whose walk of life and duties embody healing and communing with nature and spirits, especially noted in a pre-colonial Philippines. In pondering this shamanist identity as a being, orientation, vocation, and methodology, Tong seeks to study the dimensions and potentialities of human-nature relationalities, its connectedness and social interstices foregrounded in the ritualistic, and communal care of ourselves, and our ecology.
