						Tongâ€™s ongoing artistic research involves queer cultures embedded in indigenous shamanistic histories, its frictions with postcolonial realities, and the visualizations of ecology in human and nonhuman encounters. In her developing practice, the preternatural class of the spiritual Babaylan becomes one of her points of reference, whose walk of life and duties embody healing and communing with nature and spirits, especially noted in a pre-colonial Philippines. In pondering this shamanist identity as a being, orientation, vocation, and methodology, Tong seeks to study the dimensions and potentialities of human-nature relationalities, its connectedness and social interstices foregrounded in the ritualistic, and communal care of ourselves, and our ecology.
